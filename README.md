### 5. Insight

- From the cleaned data, it shows that the customer churn rate accounts for 15.7%
- It can be observed that customers who churned had a higher number of contacts with the bank compared to those who continued using the service. This could be due to disputes that required assistance for resolution or questions that needed to be addressed by customer service
- Additionally, we can observe that the majority of customers fall within the age range of 36 to 56. Moreover, a significant portion of customers predominantly use the bank's 'Blue' card. Month on book of an account is distributed almost normally, except for a significant spike at the age of 36, after which it gradually decreases.

#### Recommendation: Based on the data, we recognize the need to reduce the number of disputes related to our products to enhance customer retention. To achieve this goal, specific actions should focus on thoroughly addressing customer inquiries as soon as they reach out and improving the efficiency of the customer service department by optimizing processes and increasing productivity
